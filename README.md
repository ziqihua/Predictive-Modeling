This project aims to predict a football/soccer player's overall rating based on their skill attributes and physical characteristics. By analyzing these metrics, we can identify which attributes are most predictive of a playerâ€™s performance. 

This project could offer valuable insights for football clubs and scouts to identify promising players based on skills, helping streamline recruitment and training strategies. The analysis will also be useful for fans and fantasy football participants who want to better understand player capabilities, providing a unique perspective on player metrics beyond popular statistics.
